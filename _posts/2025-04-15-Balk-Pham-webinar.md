This is a reminder that we have a monthly update webinar today at 12 pm ET/9 am PT. 
We will hear a recent talk from Meghan Balk on perspectives on supporting ECRs in engaging in 
Ethical Open Science and also hear perspectives on community engagement and knowledge co-production from Karen Pham, 
informed by her PhD work conducting ecological studies of baobab trees in Madagascar.
