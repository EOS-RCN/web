<p> This is a reminder that we have a monthly update webinar today at 12 pm ET/9 am PT. 
We will hear an update from the mapping interoperability project (Natalie/Andrea/Simon), 
and we will also hear from Daniela Schwarz and Verónica Díez Díaz from the Berlin Museum of Natural History on work their team 
has been doing to recontextualize a paleontology collection and re-connect it to its original community and place.
