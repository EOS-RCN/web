<p>Background: Local Contexts was founded by Jane Anderson and Kim Christen in 2010. The Local Contexts project grew from 
  the needs of Indigenous and local organizations who wanted a practical method to deal with the range of intellectual property
  issues that arise in relation to managing cultural heritage materials. Emerging from Mukurtu CMS platformâ€™s use of traditional 
  knowledge fields to incorporate traditional knowledge and copyright concerns, Local Contexts started as a way to provide strategies
  for managing, sharing, and protecting digital heritage. 
</p>
  <br>
<p>
  In an increasingly complex legal, social, and cultural environment, 
  the Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Biocultural (BC) Labels offer
  Indigenous communities a tool to add cultural and historical context 
  and cultural authority to cultural heritage content in their own local 
  digital heritage archives as well as in digital archives, libraries, 
  museums and other digital repositories globally. </p>
  <br>
<p>The primary objectives of Local Contexts are to enhance and legitimize 
locally based decision-making and Indigenous governance frameworks for 
determining ownership, access, and culturally appropriate conditions for 
sharing historical, contemporary, and future collections of cultural 
heritage and Indigenous data. Local Contexts is focused on increasing 
Indigenous involvement in data governance through the integration of 
Indigenous values into data systems. Local Contexts offers digital 
strategies for Indigenous communities, cultural institutions and 
researchers through the Labels and Notices. Together they function as a 
practical mechanism to advance aspirations for Indigenous data sovereignty 
and Indigenous innovation.
