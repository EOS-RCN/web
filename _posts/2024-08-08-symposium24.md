<p> The members EOS RCN are returned home in the wake of our successful f<a href="https://eos-rcn.github.io/web/symposium2024" target="_blank">2024 Symposium </a>. We were delighted to see each other again, 
  in Keshena, WI, on the lands of the Menominee Nation. We heard wonderful talks from Riley Taitingfong, Robert Croll, and Luis Felipe Murillo, among others. We thought about what we had accomplished over the past
year and we made a plan for moving forward with intention into the coming year. </p>
  <p>Until next year, everyone!</p>
