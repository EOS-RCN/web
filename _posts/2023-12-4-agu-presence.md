<p> The Ethical Open Science RCN is coming to this year's meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, where the theme will be "Wide Open Science"! We'll make sure that ethics is part of AGU's conversation Open Science too.
Keep an eye out there for posters from our RCN on our progress so far and the lessons we learned. Project leader Jessica Blois
will also be presenting work that she has been doing with Neotoma, and her work with AdvanceGEO to promote
  diversity and inclusion in the geosciences will be shown as well. 
  Lastly, our RCN postdoctoral scholar, Natalie Raia, is co-author on several posters, in addition to being a panelist
  in an Open Science Town Hall. Look for her at the 
  “Open Samples for the Earth & Planetary Sciences” booth at the Open Science Pavilion in the exhibit hall!</p>
