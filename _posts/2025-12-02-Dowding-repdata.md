Talk Title: Representative Data
</p>
<p>
Abstract: This talk will present why FAIR data principles, on their own, 
reinforce the extractivist histories that shaped palaeontology’s uneven global data landscape and why CARE must also 
guide the future. Using Australia as a case study, I show how structural power, academic norms, and racial capitalism 
have shaped what data we have, who contributes it, and who benefits. I then outline how pluralist governance and modular 
data structures can strengthen international efforts in Open Science, and build a more just, resilient, and collaborative palaeoscience 
by focussing on the community we are and the one we wish to become.
